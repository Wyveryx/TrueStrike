# TrueStrike Testing Regimen

This document outlines the core testing scenarios required to validate TrueStrike's event detection, parsing, and display accuracy.

## 1. Incoming Heals

### [ ] Self Heals
Verify that when the player heals themselves, the addon correctly determines:
- [ ] Who cast it (Source)
- [ ] What was cast (Spell Name)
- [ ] What was the amount
- [ ] What is the spell icon

### [ ] Heals from Another Source (NPC/Player - Single/AoE)
Verify that when receiving heals from external sources, the addon correctly determines:
- [ ] Who cast it (Source)
- [ ] What was cast (Spell Name)
- [ ] What was the amount
- [ ] What is the spell icon

## 3. Outgoing Heals

### [ ] Single Target Heals
When casting a direct heal, verify:
- [ ] Who am I targeting?
- [ ] What did I cast?
- [ ] What was the amount of the heal?
- [ ] What is the icon of the cast?

### [ ] AoE / Splash Heals
When casting an AoE heal (e.g., Chain Heal, Healing Rain), verify:
- [ ] Who was targeted as the initial heal?
- [ ] Was there a splash effect from the initial target to others?
- [ ] Can we determine the target name from the nameplate (if NPC/Target)?
- [ ] What did I cast (Spell Name)?
- [ ] What are the numbers for each individual heal?
- [ ] Can I attribute my cast strictly to nameplates, or only to my active target?
- [ ] What is the icon of the cast?

## 4. Outgoing Damage

### [ ] Single Target Damage
- [ ] What action did I take (Spell or Physical)?
- [ ] What is the number of the damage dealt?
- [ ] What is the icon of the action?
- [ ] What is the target of the action?
- [ ] Ensure *only* numbers generated by the player are shown.

### [ ] AoE / Cleave Damage
- [ ] What action did I take (Spell or Physical)?
- [ ] What are the numbers for the damage dealt to each target?
- [ ] What is the icon of the action?
- [ ] What are the targets of my action?
  - [ ] *Test:* If no active target, can we attribute the action to nameplates?
  - [ ] *Test:* If actively targeting, can we attribute to the target AND surrounding nameplates?
- [ ] Ensure *only* numbers generated by the player are shown.

## 5. Pet Damage

### [ ] Classification & Tracking
- **Pet Class Definition:** Define what constitutes a pet class for tracking purposes (Hunter, Mage, Warlock, Shaman, etc.).

## 6. Item Usage Damage (Incoming & Outgoing)

Verify tracking for damage caused by usable items (e.g., Trinkets, Engineering bombs):

- [ ] What item was used?
- [ ] What was the damage number generated by the item?
- [ ] What is the icon of the item used?
- [ ] What is the target of the item?
- [ ] If the item was not used by the player, can we determine who used it?
